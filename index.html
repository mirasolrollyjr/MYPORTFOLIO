    <h3 id="friends"> Circle Of Friends</h3>
    <p> My circle of friends has been together since grade 7. There were 4 of us at first, then it grew to 6, 8, and finally 12, all from one performance task.
         This task was about the GOMBURZA movie, and we needed 4 members to watch the whole film.
          But my groupmates added more people because they wanted to.
           Once we were complete we went to Lastrella Farm and swam there to celebrate Nicole's 13th birthday.
            We also attended her church's Youth Night event, which was a fun experience. 
            Afterward, we went out for fried chicken. Since the beginning of my journey
             at LPSCI, they’ve been with me, although we dont spend much time with each other due to 
             our sections being seperated, we still bond from time to time 
             and I hope they’ll still be part of my life in the future.

     <h3 id="family">My Family</h3>
    <p>My family is incredibly friendly and welcoming. They are approachable and truly great at anything they do. This warmth isn't just internal, it extends to anyone who walks through our door, making our home a place where everyone feels comfortable and accepted.
In this family, yes, we have our own ups and downs. We experience disagreements like fighting over little things and the occasional chaos brought by my baby brother. Yet, all of it is good the way it is. It is in those moments of shared challenges that we truly learn the value of being a unit. Everyone contributes by doing their own part and keeping up with their chores, showing a strong sense of responsibility and shared ownership.
We always try our best to avoid conflicts, prioritizing peace over petty disagreements. Sometimes, arguments can't be stopped, but we treat those as temporary issues that quickly pass. We choose to focus on forgiveness and moving forward immediately.
My family is also very sporty and competitive. This isn't just about playing games, it is a reflection of our entire approach to life. Whether it is a quick round of basketball or a complicated board game, we can keep up with every challenge we face. Most importantly, we never give up on tasks we are doing, no matter how tough. We see every goal, whether on the field or in life, as a team effort. This resilience and determination is what truly defines us, pushing each of us to be the best version of ourselves.
